		<h2 id= "One"> - BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) - </h2>
		<p> The BIOS has information, usually stored in a flash chip, that will initialize a computer's hardware.
		    Without a BIOS, a computer will not be able to start properly. Although the BIOS is considered to be
		    software, one would most likely never change, update, or modify any part of it. This is different from
		    more common types of software, such as programs, applications, etc. This type of software (the BIOS) is
		    called firmware.</p>

		<h2 id= "Two"> - Case Fans - </h2>
		<p> Case fans provide ventilation for a PC's components. Many of a computer's components generate heat as a
		    waste product, mainly from the CPU and GPU. By having fans pushing air into the case and fans
		    sucking air out of the case, hot air can be removed from the inside of the computer, ensuring that the
		    components stay relatively cool. </p>
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/Components/noctua.jpg" width = "360" height = "480" alt = 
		    "Photo of two Noctua AF-14 case fans inside a PC case." /> Noctua fans are considered to be one of the
		    best case fans that one can get. However, most PC enthusiasts believe that the colour scheme looks
		    rather ugly.</p>
		<h2 id= "Three"> - Computer Case - </h2>
		<p> The case of a computer is the shell that holds most of a desktop PC's components. Computer cases come in
		    many different sizes, such as full tower (largest), mid tower, mini tower, small form factor 
		    and ultra small form factor. (smallest) Different cases will support different motherboards and more/less
		    storage bays. Cases can also have windows on the side panels, such as on the Fractal Design Define S,
		    shown below: </p>
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/Components/DefineS.jpg" width = "680" height = "500" alt = 
		    "Photo of a completed PC that uses Fractal Design's Define S case." /> This Fractal Design Define S is 
		    a mid-tower case. </p>
		<h2 id= "Four"> - CPU (Central Proccessing Unit)- </h2> 
		<p> A CPU stands for "Central Processing Unit". This component is in charge of doing all the calculations and
		    processing that happens in a computer. A CPU in extremely complex in it's contruction; with hundreds of 
		    millions of transistors inside a small rectangle of a few millimetres.
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/Components/CPU.jpg" width = "500" height = "500" alt = 
		    "Photo of an Intel Celeron M 370 CPU" /> This Intel Celeron M 370 CPU from the year
		    2005 uses little power as it was designed for use in smaller laptops. The dark rectangle in the middle is
		    called the "die" and it contains a total of 144 million transistors. The total size of the CPU is about 
		    35x35mm. Some CPUs have a metal cover over the die that is called a "heat spreader."

		    Info source</a> ( Intel® Celeron® M Processor 370 (1M Cache, 1.50 GHz, 400 MHz FSB) Product Specifications. 
		    (n.d.). Retrieved February 25, 2018, from https://ark.intel.com/products/27145/Intel-Celeron-M-Processor-370-
		    1M-Cache-1_50-GHz-400-MHz-FSB ) </p>
		<h2 id= "Five"> - GPU (Graphics Processsing Unit)- </h2> 
		<p> A GPU stands for "Graphics Processing Unit". This component is solely used to help the CPU create and display
		    images, videos, and other graphical objects. A GPU's construction is similar to a CPU. GPUs are commonly
		    found as "graphics chips", which are built into motherboards, or as "graphics cards", separate PCBs 
		    (Printed Circuit Boards) that can be plugged into a motherboard.
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/Components/GPU.jpg" width = "640" height = "480" alt = 
		    "Photo of a Radeon x1900 graphics card with its heatsink removed." /> This ATI Radeon X1900 graphics card
		    had its heat sink removed so that actual GPU can be seen. The GPU itself is the green square in the middle of
		    the card. It is similar in appearance to a CPU.
		<h2 id= "Six"> - PSU (Power Supply Unit) - </h2>
		<p> A PSU (Power Supply Unit) is what provides the other components with power that the PC needs to function.
		    Power supply units are designed to be highly robust in both their physical construction and in their
		    electronics. This is because other components such as the CPU and GPU need a very steady and constant flow
		    of DC electricity to work. These components are also very sensitive to voltage changes.
		    It is common for an entire motherboard and its components to fail due to a sudden failure of the power 
		    supply unit. Most power supplies usually provide a combination of 3.3V, 6V and 12V to the PC. Common
		    brands of PSUs include: Antec, Corsair, EVGA, Cooler Master, and Thermaltake.
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/Components/PSU.jpg" width = "700" height = "500" alt = 
		    "Photo of a computer power supply unit made by OCZ Technology." /> Above: An average power supply
		    unit, made by OCZ Technology. This unit is semi-modular, meaning some power cables can be removed or 
		    added. Photo source:<a href= "https://www.pcmech.com/article/how-to-diagnose-power-supply-failure/">

		<h2 id= "Seven"> - Motherboard - </h2>
		<p> The motherboard is a large PCB (Printed Circuit Board) where the all the communication between a 
		    computer's components happens. The CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage all are connected to the motherboard, 
		    where data is sent between the components. A motherboard also has all the ports that allow the connection
		    of computer peripherals. Computer peripherals are the devices that one uses to send input and receive output
		    to/from a computer. Common computer peripherals include: a mouse, a keyboard, a monitor, computer speakers,
		    and microphones. </p>
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/Components/motherboard.jpg" width = "440" height = "560" alt = 
		    "Photo of an MSI Z370 motherboard." /> Above: an MSI Z370 motherboard. There is a wide assortment of
		    ports. </p>
		<h2 id= "Eight"> - RAM (Random Access Memory) - </h2>
		<p> A computer's RAM (Random Access Memory) holds temporary information that the CPU needs to do 
	            calculations and also contains code that the computer will need to use throughout it's operation. 
		    This type of memory needs to be accessed very quickly, from various locations inside the RAM's memory chips.
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/Components/RAM.jpg" width = "580" height = "370" alt = 
		    "Photo of three different sticks of both laptop and desktop RAM." /> Above: An assortment of both laptop and
		    desktop RAM. Each individual piece is often referred to as a single "RAM module" or a single "stick of RAM". </p>
