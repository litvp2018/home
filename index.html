		<h2 id= "One"> Introduction </h2>
		<p id= SoYouThink> So you think you want to build a PC? </p>
		<p> Here is a guide to help you through your PC build. This page is just one of the many that 
		    touch on the topic of PC building. It was not the author's intent to create the best PC building
		    webpage, but rather a simple "all in one" webpage. Along this webpage, there will be several 
		    links to computer hardware definitions that you may visit, if you are unsure about a term or 
		    component. Most of the photos on this page are from my own PC build. So buckle up and perhaps you'll soon be getting that sweet 4k 60fps in all the 
		    <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_(video_game_industry)">triple A titles</a>. 
		    Note: This guide is merely a recommendation; some steps/tips featured on this site may not 
		    be necessary for the completion of your PC build. Please use you best judgement 
		    and always check twice before jamming one thing into another.</p>
		
		<h2 id= "Two"> Preparation of the Case and Case Fans </h2>
		<p> The very first step after gathering all your parts is to prepare your PC&rsquo;s case.
		    Ensure your working area is clean and free of any clutter, as small parts such as screws
		    may be lost if dropped or misplaced during this process. Once you have you PC case in
		    the working area of your choice, begin by removing the side panels. There usually are
		    thumbscrews that can be unscrewed. Afterwards, the whole panel can be slid backwards and away. </p>
		<p> Case fans are important for ventilation. Without adequate airflow inside your case, your PC may 
		    overheat. When installing your fans, it is important to note which way the fans spin. There will
		    be arrows molded into the plastic on the side of the fan, indicating direction of airflow. (See
		    example below.) </p>
		<p> <img src = "PCImages/fanairflow.jpg" width = "600" height = "240" alt = "Picture of PC fan, showing 
		    two small arrows indicating which direction the fans spins and which direction the air flows, 
		    circled in red. " /> In this photo, the arrow pointing up indicates the direction of airflow. </p>
		<p> As a general rule of thumb, air should flow from the front of the case to the back. (Hot air
		    should be blown out the back,) and from bottom to top. (Since heat rises.) </p>
		<p> <img src = "PCImages/noctua.jpg" width = "300" height = "400" alt = "Picture of two Noctua
		    AF-14 140mm case fans installed in the front of a PC case, acting as intake fans." /> Above: Two Noctua
		    AF-14 140mm case fans installed in the front of the case to act as intake fans. </p>
		<h2 id= "Three"> Installation of the PSU and Preparation of the Motherboard </h2>
		<p> <img src = "PCImages/PSU.jpg" width = "480" height = "400" alt = 
		    "Picture of a EVGA G3 650W PSU inside a completed PC build, circled in red. " /> Above: A Typical PSU
		    installed in a PC, circled in red. </p>
		<p> Installing the PSU is simple. You can simply slide the unit into the case, making sure the exhaust fan
		    is not obstructed. (There should be a ventilation hole) Be sure to secure the PSU to the back of the case
		    with the screws provided. All the cables can be tucked into the case.
		<p> Preparing the motherboard will be the most delicate part of the whole PC building process. Although it
		    may seem daunting, if you make sure you know what you're doing and treat the components with utmost care, 
		    things will go smoothly.
		<p> <img src = "PCImages/motherboard.jpg" width = "400" height = "500" alt = 
		    "Picture of a bare MSI Z370 Gaming Plus motherboard with nothing installed." /> Above: A bare motherboard
		    with nothing installed. It is a good idea to rest the motherboard ontop of the box it came in. 
		    (or any other clean, flat surface of your choice) </p>
