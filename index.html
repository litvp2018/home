		<p id= SoYouThink> So you think you want to build a PC? </p>
		<p> Here is a guide to help you through your PC build. This page is just one of the many that 
		    touch on the topic of PC building. It was not the author's intent to create the best PC building
		    webpage, but rather a simple "all in one" webpage. Along this webpage, there will be several 
		    links to computer hardware definitions that you may visit, if you are unsure about a term or 
		    component. Most of the photos on this page are from my own PC build. So buckle up and perhaps you'll
		    soon be getting that sweet 4k 60fps in all the 
		    <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_(video_game_industry)">triple A titles</a>. 
		    Note: This guide is merely a recommendation; some steps/tips featured on this site may not 
		    be necessary for the completion of your PC build. Please use you best judgement 
		    and always check twice before jamming one thing into another.</p>
		
		<h2 id= "Two"> - Preparation of the Case and Case Fans -  </h2>
		<h3> Preparation of the Case: </h3>
		<p> The very first step after gathering all your parts is to prepare your PC&rsquo;s 
		    <a href = "Components.html#Three">case</a>.
		    Ensure your working area is clean and free of any clutter, as small parts such as screws
		    may be lost if dropped or misplaced during this process. Once you have you PC case in
		    the working area of your choice, begin by removing the side panels. There usually are
		    thumbscrews that can be unscrewed. Afterwards, the whole panel can be slid backwards and away. </p>
		<h3> Case Fans: </h3>
		<p> <a href = "Components.html#Two">Case fans</a> are important for ventilation. 
		    Without adequate airflow inside your case, your PC may overheat. When installing your fans, it is 
		    important to note which way the fans spin. There willbe arrows molded into the plastic on the side of the
		    fan, indicating direction of airflow. (See example below.) </p>
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/fanairflow.jpg" width = "600" height = "240" alt = "Picture of PC fan, showing 
		    two small arrows indicating which direction the fans spins and which direction the air flows, 
		    circled in red. " /> In this photo, the arrow pointing up indicates the direction of airflow. Photo source: 
		    <a href = "http://www.overclock.net/forum/246-air-cooling/1467079-anyone-corsair-af120-140-led-case-fans-fan-direction-question.html#post21781605">
		    francisw19, author at www.overclock.net</a> </p>
		<p> As a general rule of thumb, air should flow from the front of the case to the back. (Hot air should be blown out the back,)
		    and from bottom to top. (Since heat rises.) After you install each case fan, make sure you plug the fan's cable into
		    one of the fan headers. (3-pin or 4-pin)</p>
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/noctua.jpg" width = "360" height = "480" alt = "Picture of two Noctua
		    AF-14 140mm case fans installed in the front of a PC case, acting as intake fans." /> Above: Two Noctua
		    AF-14 140mm case fans installed in the front of the case to act as intake fans. </p>
		<h2 id= "Three"> - Installation of the PSU and Preparation of the Motherboard - </h2>
		<h3> Installation of the PSU: </h3>
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/PSU.jpg" width = "480" height = "400" alt = 
		    "Picture of a EVGA G3 650W PSU inside a completed PC build, circled in red. " /> Above: A Typical PSU
		    installed in a PC, circled in red. </p>
		<p> Installing the <a href = "Components.html#Six">PSU</a> is simple. You can simply slide the unit into the case, making sure the exhaust fan
		    is not obstructed. (There should be a ventilation hole) Be sure to secure the PSU to the back of the case
		    with the screws provided. All the cables can be tucked into the case.
		<h3> Preparation of the Motherboard: </h3>
		<p> Preparing the <a href = "Components.html#Seven">motherboard</a> will be the most delicate part of the whole PC building process. Although it
		    may seem daunting, if you make sure you know what you're doing and treat the components with utmost care, 
		    things will go smoothly.
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/motherboard.jpg" width = "400" height = "500" alt = 
		    "Picture of a bare MSI Z370 Gaming Plus motherboard with nothing installed." /> Above: A bare motherboard
		    with nothing installed. It is a good idea to rest the motherboard ontop of the box it came in. 
		    (or any other clean, flat surface of your choice) </p>
		<p> The <a href = "Components.html#Four">CPU</a> and <a href = "Components.html#Eight">RAM</a> will need to be installed to the motherboard before the motherboard is installed to the
		    case. To install the CPU, begin by unlatching the metal arm that is connected to the metal cover that sits
		    on top of the CPU socket. After you have exposed the pins inside the socket, you may install the CPU by 
		    lining the the small triangular symbol on the CPU with the socket. Afterwards, gently
		    place it in the socket, dropping it straight down from a height of 2-3mm. (Do not slide or press the CPU into the socket. Gravity will 
		    work just fine.) After confirming the CPU is sitting correctly in the socket, latch the metal arm and its metal cover back into place. 
		    The black plastic cover should pop off, exposing the metal top of the CPU. Afterwards, you can install your CPU cooler. Stock Intel/AMD 
		    coolers (that come with the CPU in the box) will already have thermal paste. Be sure make sure the cooler has latched onto the motherboard 
		    firmly before proceeding with installation of the RAM.
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/SocketZero.jpg" width = "440" height = "560" alt = 
		    "Photo of an Intel LGA1151 socket, with it's protective black cover still attached." /> </p>
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/SocketOne.jpg" width = "440" height = "560" alt = 
		    "Photo of an exposed LGA1151 socket, without a CPU in place, showing many CPU pins." /> </p>
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/SocketTwo.jpg" width = "440" height = "560" alt = 
		    "Photo of an Intel i5 8400 CPU in a LGA 1151 socket, with the metal cover unlatched." /> </p>
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/SocketThree.jpg" width = "440" height = "560" alt = 
		    "Photo of an Intel i5 8400 CPU in a LGA 1151 socket, with the metal cover latched, securing the CPU." /> </p>
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/SocketFour.jpg" width = "440" height = "560" alt = 
		    "Photo of an Intel stock cooler in detail, correctly installed on an MSI Z370 Motherboard." /> </p>
		<p> When installing the RAM, make sure to install the sticks in pairs. Usually, the RAM slots on the motherboard will be colour coded for this. In my
		    case, two of the slots are black and the other two are red. Although it depends on the motherboard, (check the manual) in my case, I need to install
		    my RAM in the two red slots first. Before you install the sticks, make sure to pull back the tabs at either end of the slots. Afterwards, take the
		    stick and push it into the slot, going in at a slight angle so that one end will go in first, before the other. It will take a bit of force but you
		    should hear a click, indicating that the tab has locked into place with the stick of RAM. You can then push the other end of the stick into place, 
		    making sure the tab you pulled down locks. Repeat these steps for the other stick(s) of RAM.
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/RAMOne.jpg" width = "560" height = "440" alt = 
		    "Photo of the RAM slots on a MSI Z370 motherboard, one slot taken by a stick of RAM. The tabs on one other slot have been pulled back." /> </p>
		<h2 id= "Four"> - Installation of the Motherboard and Storage (HDDs and SSDs) - </h2>
		<h3> Installation of the Motherboard: </h3>
		<p> Now that you have installed both the CPU and the RAM, we can install the motherboard to the case. Start by attaching the IO shield to the case.
		    The IO shield will come with your motherboard; it's a metal sheet that has holes and labels for the ports at the back of the motherboard. When you
		    are snapping it into place from the inside of the case, make sure you don't cut yourself or bend the small metal tabs protruding from the shield.
		    Now you can install the motherboard standoffs. These are small metal cylinders that are screwed into the case, lifting the motherboard up by a few
		    millimeters from the side of the case. This is so that the motherboard doesn't short out on any pieces of metal it shouldn't be touching.
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/Standoff.jpg" width = "560" height = "440" alt = 
		    "Photo of a single motherboard standoff that has been installed to the case." /> </p>
		<p> After all the standoffs have been installed to the case, the motherboard can be screwed onto the standoffs. Afterwards, you can connect the 
		    power cables to the motherboard, which includes the 24-pin motherboard cable and the 8-pin CPU cable. Other cables such as the front panel
		    I/O cables can also be connected. Make sure you don't forget to wire the power button so that you can turn on your PC when you are finished. </p>
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/PreparedMotherboard.jpg" width = "500" height = "660" alt = 
		    "Photo of a MSI Z370 motherboard, installed in a case, with several ports labelled." />Note: your motherboard may have more or less ports/slots.
		    Consult the manual that came with your motherboard to find out specific details and locations of the ports/slots. </p>
		<h3> Installation of the Storage: </h3>
		<p> The two most main types of PC storage options are hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs). Another name for a hard disk drive is
		    hard drive, or hard disk. In terms of installation, the steps are almost identical for both HDDs and SSDs. Desktop HDDs are usually 3.5 inches wide
		    whereas SDDs in general are 2.5 inches wide. The screw size and placement of the screw holes will be slightly different, but they both use 
		    four screws in total for mounting.
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/Storage.jpg" width = "665" height = "560" alt = 
		    "Photo of the inside of a PC case, showing both a HDD and an SSD." /> I chose to have both an SSD and a HDD in my PC build. Note how the cables
		    are properly organized inside the case. (Cable management should be practiced if you want to do that extra step to make things a bit nicer) </p>
		<p> The HDD/SDD can be screwed to the case with four screws; then you can plug in the SATA power cables. (The ones that are connected to the PSU.)
		    The final step is to use a SATA data cable to connect the HDD/SDD to the motherboard's SATA ports.
		<h2 id= "Five"> - Installation of the GPU - </h2>
		<p> The <a href = "Components.html#Five">GPU</a> usually is installed in the form of a graphics card. This component is connected to the motherboard through a PCIE slot. Most motherboards/
		    CPUs come with integrated graphics, but if you want to be playing newer games at high frame rates, you will need a graphics card. To install a
		    graphics card, begin by taking off the PCIe slot covers/shields located at the back of the case.</p>
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/PCIEShields.jpg" width = "440" height = "560" alt = 
		    "Photo of the expansion slot covers/shields in a PC case, with two of them removed." /> Above: Two shields have been removed for the graphics card
		    that I will be installing. Some graphics cards may only need to have one shield removed. </p> 
		<p> The PCIe slot has a single tab at the end, similar to the tabs on a RAM slot. This tab need to be pulled back before the graphics card is inserted.
		    When you insert the graphics card, make sure the tab clicks back into place, locking the graphics card to the slot. The thumbscrews from the PCIe
		    shields will also need to be screwed back, adding another layer of security for the graphics card. (See photo below.) </p>
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/SecuredGPUTwo.jpg" width = "440" height = "560" alt = 
		    "Photo of a graphics card that has two thumbscrews securing it to the PC's case." /> </p> 
		<p> Some graphics cards will need a 6-pin power cable to function. (This includes the one that I chose for my build.) Most PSUs have this cable, which
		    can be plugged in like you would with the 8-pin CPU power cable.
		<h2 id= "Six"> - Final Steps - </h2>
		<p> After you have installed all the PC components and have connected all the necessary power and data cables, you can turn your PC on for the very
		    first time. You will need to go to something called the <a href = "Components.html#One">BIOS</a>. Upon pressing the power button, you need to repeatedly press a key to access the BIOS.
		    consult your motherboard's manual for which key to press. If you didn't make it to the BIOS the first try, you can safely shut down the PC by 
		    holding the power button. Once you are in the BIOS, you can check to see if your motherboard recognizes all the components that have been installed.
		    This includes the RAM, storage (HDDs and SSDs) and the graphics card. If a component is not showing up, check your cables and try again. 
		    If everyhting does show up, you can reboot and install Windows or any other OS (Operating System) of your choice. Once windows has been installed 
		    on your PC, make sure to download and install all the latest drivers, especially for your graphics card. </p>
		<p> Once these final steps are completed, reboot your PC. Congratulations! You can now start using your brand new PC. Make sure you have an
		    Antivirus program (I highly suggest Malwarebytes) installed and you everything should be good.
