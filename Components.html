		<h2 id= "One"> PSU (Power Supply Unit) </h2>
		<p> A PSU (Power Supply Unit) is what provides the other components with power that the PC needs to function.
		    Power supply units are designed to be highly robust in both their physical contruction and in their
		    electronics. This is because other components such as the CPU and GPU need a very steady and constant flow
		    of DC electricity to work. These components are also very sensitive to voltage changes.
		    It is common for an entire motherboard and its components to fail due to a sudden failure of the power 
		    supply unit. Most power supplies usually provide a combination of 3.3V, 6V and 12V to the PC. Common
		    brands of PSUs include: Antec, Corsair, EVGA, Cooler Master, and Thermaltake.

		    unit, made by OCZ Technology. This unit is semi-modular, meaning some power cables can be removed or 
		    added. <a href= "https://www.pcmech.com/article/how-to-diagnose-power-supply-failure/">Photo source</a></p>
		<h2 id= "Two"> Computer Case </h2>
		<p> The case of a computer is the shell that holds most of a desktop PC's components. Computer cases come in
		    many different sizes, such as full tower (largest), mid tower, mini tower, small form factor 
		    and ultra small form factor. (smallest) Different cases will support different motherboards and more/less
		    storage bays. Cases can also have windows on the side panels, such as on the Fractal Design Define S,
		    shown below: </p>
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/Components/DefineS.jpg" width = "680" height = "500" alt = 
		    "Photo of a completed PC that uses Fractal Design's Define S case." /> This Fractal Design Define S is
		    considered to be a mid-tower case. </p>
		<h2 id= "Three"> Case Fans </h2>
		<p> Case fans provide ventilation for a PC's components. Many of a computer's components generate heat as a
		    waste product, mainly from the CPU and GPU. By having fans pushing air into the case and fans
		    sucking air out of the case, hot air can be removed from the inside of the computer, ensuring that the
		    components stay relatively cool. </p>
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/Components/noctua.jpg" width = "360" height = "480" alt = 
		    "Photo of two Noctua AF-14 case fans inside a PC case." /> Noctua fans are considered to be one of the
		    best case fans that one can get. However, most PC enthusiasts believe that the colour scheme looks
		    rather ugly when paired with more traditional coloured components. </p>
		<h2 id= "Four"> Motherboard </h2>
		<p> The motherboard is a large PCB (Printed Circuit Board) where the all the communication between a 
		    computer's components happens. The CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage all are connected to the motherboard, 
		    where data is sent between the components. A motherboard also has all the ports that allow the connection
		    of computer peripherals. Computer peripherals are the devices that one uses to send input and recieve output
		    to/from a computer. Common computer perpherals include: a mouse, a keyboard, a monitor, computer speakers,
		    and microphones. </p>
		<p> <img class= "bordered" src = "PCImages/Components/motherboard.jpg" width = "400" height = "500" alt = 
		    "Photo of an MSI Z370 motherboard." /> Above: an MSI Z370 motherboard. There is a wide assortment of
		    ports. </p>
